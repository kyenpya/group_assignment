                        <p class="havuti">Kitfo (Amharic: ክትፎ, IPA: [kɨtfo]) is an Ethiopian traditional dish which 
                        originated among the Gurage people. It consists of minced raw beef, marinated in mitmita 
                        and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter infused with herbs 
                        and spices).
